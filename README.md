# 🦠 Cyber Survivors

**Cyber Survivors** is a **2D survivor-like defense game** where you must protect your digital folders against endless waves of computer viruses inspired by real-world threats (ransomware, spyware, adware, trojans, worms, etc.).  
The goal: **survive 30 minutes** on your digital desktop, manage your defenses, upgrade your modules, and adapt to random cyber events.

## 🛠️ Gameplay & Mechanics

### 📦 Folders
- Start with the **Genesis Folder** (200 HP, contains decoy files, stores core modules).  
- Up to **4 total folders** (yellow, blue, red, green).  
- If folders are placed next to each other, they reinforce each other.  
- Additional folders spawn every 3 minutes (up to 4 max).  

### 🔧 Modules
- **Weapons**: Offensive tools (thermal paste slows, plasma arc, lag spike, blue screen grenade, etc.).  
- **Defenses**: Firewalls, antivirus, regeneration, shields.  
- **Support**: Buffs, detection of hidden viruses, economy boosts.  
- **Upgrades**: Merge 2 modules of the same rarity to create a stronger one.  

### 💰 Economy
- Virtual currency: **QuantumCash**, earned by killing viruses.  
- Spend QuantumCash on:
  - **Loot boxes** (tier 1–3, higher cost = better rewards).  
  - **Shop** (5 rotating items every 3 minutes, more expensive than loot boxes).  
- Beware: **Spyware can steal up to 10% of your QuantumCash** if not defeated in time.  

### ⚔️ Viruses
Each virus category has unique mechanics:  
- **Adware**: Pop-ups to close.  
- **Spyware**: Steals currency.  
- **File viruses**: Block weapons or the market.  
- **Worms**: Spread automatically unless blocked by firewalls.  
- **Trojans**: Fake files, open backdoors.  
- **Botnets**: Coordinated attacks on firewalls.  
- **Polymorphic/Metamorphic viruses**: Change shape to avoid detection.  
- **Rootkits**: Hide other malware.  
- **Ransomware**: Lock folders until neutralized.  

### 🔄 Events
- Pressure plates (bonus/malus zones).  
- Viral overload zones (damage + invisible enemies).  
- Fake files (Trojan bait with risk/reward).  
- Currency drops requiring movement of the Genesis Folder.
